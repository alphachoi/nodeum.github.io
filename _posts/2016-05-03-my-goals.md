title: My goals in 2016
summary: Not a New Year's Resolution!
---

> Disclaimer: This is not my New Year's Resolution!

I have been feeling a bit down lately, mostly because of the fact that I'm dealing with too many bullshits at the same time. Particularly, today I felt so sad that I wasn't able to do anything. Mostly about my studying and my emotional status. _(I feel better now though)_

But then I decided to stand up and said to myself **_'F**k it! Let's not give a shit!'_**. Let's stop the sadness, be brave and learn something!

So, today, I want to share with you my lifelong goals as well as the skills I want to achieve in 2016. This is my manifesto, my dedication and my ultimate goal.

# The Goals

- Be myself
- Be happy
- Be nice to everybody
- Have fun
- Learn more about web development and the tech industry
- Be more engaged
- Be brave when facing obstacles
- Find more friends
- Stop worrying too much about tomorrow, appreciate what I have today
- Keep moving forward

This is a short post (and rather emotional), but I hope this will be a  life manifesto for myself. This post will be my companion for the next couple of decades.
