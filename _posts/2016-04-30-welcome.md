> "Stay hungry, stay foolish."

_That is perhaps one of my favorite quotes from Steve Jobs._

Steve Jobs is an iconic entrepreneur and motivator of this generation. He's _the misfit, the rebel, the trouble-maker_ of this century. He left me with lots of questions in how I was living my life, what I contributed to the society and pretty much is the reason why I could get to this stage of my life. I am learning so much and working hard to gain more knowledge about the thing I love the most - the Web.

## Me

My name is Chi To - preferably called **Steven To**. I am a tech enthusiast, friendly human and junior front-end developer based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

I _love_ to design and code the web. I know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SASS and Gulp. Currently leveling up my JavaScript and learning about ReactJS.

## Nodeum

I don't talk much, so writing is perhaps my preferred way of sharing my own thoughts.

Nodeum is my little journal focused mainly in web development, design and my personal life. Sharing to me is an essential part of life, it's what makes the Internet work. I will be writing more, so stay tuned for new posts!
